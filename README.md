# Diabetes Prediction API

## Overview
The **Diabetes Prediction API** is a machine learning-based API designed to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on input health data. It uses a pre-trained model to classify input data into two categories: **diabetic** or **non-diabetic**.

This project leverages **FastAPI** for the API implementation and uses a machine learning model that was trained on a dataset to predict diabetes based on various health attributes like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.

## Features
- **POST** `/diabetes_prediction`: Accepts user input and returns a prediction indicating whether the person is diabetic or not.

## Technology Stack
- **FastAPI**: For building the REST API.
- **Pickle**: For loading the pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and input parsing.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ogowaily/diabetes-prediction-api.git
cd diabetes-prediction-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the API Locally
Once dependencies are installed, run the FastAPI app locally:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
This will start the API server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 4. Test the API
You can test the API using any HTTP client (e.g., Postman, cURL) or through Python's `requests` library.

**Example Request**:
```python
import json
import requests

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/diabetes_prediction'

input_data_for_model = {
    'pregnancies': 5,
    'Glucose': 166,
    'BloodPressure': 72,
    'SkinThickness': 19,
    'Insulin': 175,
    'BMI': 25.8,
    'DiabetesPedigreeFunction': 0.587,
    'Age': 51
}

input_json = json.dumps(input_data_for_model)

response = requests.post(url, data=input_json)

print(response.json())
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "prediction": "The person is diabetic"
}
```

## Model Description
The machine learning model used for diabetes prediction is a classification model that has been trained on a dataset of health records. The model takes in multiple health parameters as input, such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more, and classifies the individual as **diabetic** or **non-diabetic**.
